# **IBM: GPXX0PICEN : Create a Cryptocurrency Trading Algorithm in Python**

The prominence of Cryptocurrencies as a means of transaction and investment vehicle has seen astronomical growth in recent years - but what is it and how is it different than the traditional currencies we're used to? The currencies you are familar with and likely use on a day-to-day basis, such as the US Dollar and the Euro, are known as *fiat currencies*. They are issued by the government and there exists a central authority, such as a central bank, to regulate and govern it's use. In stark contrast, a defining feature of a *Cryptocurrency* is that there is no central regulatory authority. Instead, transactions are held in a ledger or database which is secured cryptographically. Both types of currencies have their advantages and disadvantages.

While this is all interesting, the most important question you might be asking is "what's in it for me?" As an individual investor, you may find success in trading Cryptocurrencies to take home a profit - but unfortunately, that often involves a significant time investment, tracking charts and prices to determine what the next trade to make is. If that sounds appealing, then by all means, enjoy! It is certainly a viable option.

If, however, you prefer a little more of a hands-off approach, a trading algorithm may be here to save the day. Algorithmic trading is a way to automate making decisions on when to buy or sell an asset based on some pre-programmed instructions and criteria. You design and implement a trading strategy and let the computer do the work for you! If the strategy is effective and well-tested, then you can potentially earn money while you sleep without having to spend hours staring at charts.

In this Guided Project, you will take a first dive into the world of algorithmic trading by implementing a simple strategy and testing its performance.

*After completing this guided project you will be able to:*

* Fetch Cryptocurrency market prices and data
* Perform basic analysis of market behaviour
* Implement a simple algorithmic trading strategy
* Analyze the performance of the trading algorithm
