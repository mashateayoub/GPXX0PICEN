    "We will use the Alpaca exchange to build our trading bot. Alpaca is a free and API first exchange that allows us to buy and sell stocks via API calls.\n",

    "To get started with Alpaca:\n",
    "\n",
    "1- Navigate to the Alpaca main page and click on Sign Up to create an account\n",
    "\n",
    "2- Enter your credentials and click on \"Sign Up for free.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "3- Verify your account by going to the email used to create your account and retrieve your verification code.\n",
    "\n",
    "4- Now that you created and verified your account, we need to change our Alpaca environment from real to simulated. That way, we can make trades and build our algorithm with simulated money. To do so, once you're on the Main Alpaca page, click on the \"Live trading\" dropdown and select the Paper account option."

When you're in the main dashboard, you should see \"Your API Keys\" on the right, click on \"View\" and your API keys should be shown. You can then click \"Generate Key\". Please copy and save the value of the Endpoint, API Key ID, and Secret Key.\n",
